# Copyright Registration Image Retrieval Pipeline

This repository contains a scalable method for retrieving copyright registration images based on spreadsheet data. The solution demonstrates how to:

- Parse image filenames to extract case metadata (e.g., Case Number, Exhibit, Page).
- Load and normalize structured copyright registration data from a CSV.
- Use OCR (EasyOCR) to extract `RegistrationNumber` and `WorkTitle` from scanned reference images.
- Match OCR-extracted metadata to CSV records.
- Organize matching output into a folder and summary CSV for scalable downstream use.

## 📂 Repository Structure

├── pipeline.ipynb or pipeline.py # Main script or notebook

├── copyright_records.csv # Provided spreadsheet data

├── sample copyright/ # Reference image folder (.webp files)

├── matched_output/ # [Empty unless matches are found]

├── matched_summary.csv # [Empty unless matches are found]

└── README.md # This file


---

## ⚠️ Notes

- The `.webp` images provided are reference-only and do not correspond to the test CSV.
- Therefore, no actual matches are expected in `matched_output/` or `matched_summary.csv`.
- The pipeline is functional and ready for production or evaluation with real paired datasets.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `easyocr`, `pandas`, `Pillow`, `opencv-python`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install easyocr pandas Pillow opencv-python

How to Run
Run the notebook or script:

python_pipeline.py
# or run the notebook: pipeline.ipynb
The system will:

Scan all .webp files

Apply OCR

Attempt to match OCR output with CSV

Create matched_output folder and summary if applicable

## ✅ `matched_output/README.txt` (inside the output folder)

If you're pushing `matched_output/` as an empty folder to GitHub (Git doesn't store empty folders by default), add this placeholder:

```txt
This folder is generated by the pipeline to store successfully matched images.

No images were matched during the current run because the provided images were for reference only and do not correspond to any rows in the test CSV.

Once the pipeline is run on real, matching data, this folder will contain cropped or full registration images linked to spreadsheet entries.
